My random notes. Cleanup README later
// TODO: Make note of passed considerations in ReadMe
    // - Overdraft
    // - OwnerName + BankName sanitization
    // - Simple Guids for Acc + Routing Id
    // - RoutingSystem using property injection
    // - Bank as a param for Account constructor (why'd I do it?)
    // - I'm going with the assumption that a withdraw > 500 is ok if  account is transferring
    // - Are the Guids I'm using unique enough? Should I improve on uniqueness?
